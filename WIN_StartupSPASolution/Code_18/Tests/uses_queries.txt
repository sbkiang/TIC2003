// what if we get 
while w; variable v; print pn
Select w such that Uses(pn,v)

we decide the Database function based on the synonym's entity. So, the old method wouldn't work
or 
Select v such that Uses(pn,v)
    I don't have a function for variable. but i can just test all the function?
    Or i think i should take the entity from the suchThat.first and suchThat.second
    
    for uses(pn,v), we only need to care about whether the suchThat.first is part of select because the 2nd input is always variable
    So, it's either generic or specific
